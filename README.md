This is the assignment/homework question w.r.t. 2 courses __Statistical Computing__ & __Introductory Data Science__.

# Statistical-Computing

For Statistical Computing, please check the outside __HW 1~7__, each folder contains the slide and the HW solution. The HW questions are in the last few pages of the slides, and only coding problems are uploaded here. 

## Syllabus:

1. Optimization and Solving Nonlinear Equations
2. EM Optimization Methods
3. Numerical Integration
4. Simulation and Monte Carlo Integration
5. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
6. Bootstrapping 

# Introductory Data Science

For Introductory Data Science course, they're all in the __DS__ folder. The HW questions and answers are all in the __Homework Q&A__ folder as .ipynb files. Lecture codebook is in the __Lecture Codebooks__ folder, they're all .ipynb files. The rest files in __DS__ folder is for the Final Project, including the code and data. FYI, we used the UJIndoorLoc dataset from the ___UCI Machine Learning Repository___, and you can check the website here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/310/ujiindoorloc

## Syllabus:

1. Python Programming: Basics/numpy and Pandas/OOP/Visualization/simulations

2. Regression: Linear regression/model selection/cross validation/bootstrap
   
3. Classification: Logistic regression/KNN/na√Øve Bayes/decision tree/random forest
   
4. Neural network: Overview/SGD/CNN
   
5. Causal inference (if time permits): Potential outcomes/randomized experiments/observational data
