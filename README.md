# Statistical-Computing

This is the assignment/homework question w.r.t. 2 courses "Statistical Computing" & "Introductory Data Science".


For Statistical Computing, the homework questions are in the last few slides, and only coding problems are uploaded here. 

For Introductory Data Science course, the questions and answers are all in the .ipynb files, and you can find the final project code and data in the parallel files. FYI, we used the UJIndoorLoc dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and you can check the website here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/310/ujiindoorloc

I only put coding part in the "code" section, if you want to review the whole solutions and want a better structure and view, plz check the .ipynb file, thanks!
